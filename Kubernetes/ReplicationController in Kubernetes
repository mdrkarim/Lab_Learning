The Nautilus DevOps team wants to create a ReplicationController to deploy some pods. They are going to deploy some application on these pods which need some highly available infrastructure. Below you can find exact details and accordingly please create the ReplicationController.


Create a ReplicationController using nginx image preferably with latest tag and name it as nginx-replicationcontroller.

Labels app should be nginx_app, and labels type should be front-end. The container should be named as nginx-container and also make sure replica counts are 3.

All pods should be running state.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

sudo touch nginx-replicationcontroller.yaml
sudo vi nginx-replicationcontroller.yaml
