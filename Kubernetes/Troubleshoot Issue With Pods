One of the junior DevOps team member was working on to deploy a 
stack on Kubernetes cluster. 
Somehow the pod is not coming up and its failing with some errors. 
We need to fix this as soon as possible. Please take a look into it.


There is a pod named webserver, 
the container under it named as httpd-container and its using image httpd:latest

There is a sidecar container as well named as sidecar-container 
which is using ubuntu:latest image.

Look into the issue and fix the same, 
make sure pod is in running state before clicking the Finish button.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured 
to work with the kubernetes cluster.


kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod webserver
kubectl edit pod webserver
