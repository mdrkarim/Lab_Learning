The Nautilus DevOps team want to install and set up a simple httpd web server on all app servers in Stratos DC. They also want to deploy a sample web page using Ansible only. Therefore, prepare the required playbook to complete this task. Find more details about the task below.


We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible on jump host. Create a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible on jump host itself.

Using the playbook install httpd web server on all app servers, and make sure its service is up and running.

Create a file /var/www/html/index.html with content:

This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!

Using lineinfile Ansible module add some more content in /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:
Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!

Also make sure this new line is added at the top of the file.

The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.

The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0655 on all app servers.

Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.

cd  /home/thor/ansible && sudo vi playbook.yml
