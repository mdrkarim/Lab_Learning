There are directory structures in the Stratos Datacenter that need to be changed, including directories that need to be linked to the default Apache document root. We need to accomplish this task using only Puppet as per the instructions given below:


Create a puppet programming file ecommerce.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on puppet master node i.e on Jump Server. Within that define a class symlink and perform below mentioned tasks:

Create a symbolic link through puppet programming code. The source path should be /opt/devops and destination path should be /var/www/html on all Puppet agents i.e on all App Servers.

Create a blank file media.txt under /opt/devops directory on all puppet agent nodes i.e on all App Servers.

Note: Please perform this task using demo.pp only, do not create any separate inventory file.


cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests
vi ecommerce.pp



class symlink  {

  # Creating symlink 
  file { '/opt/data':
    ensure => 'link',
    target => '/var/www/html',
  }

  # This creates a file
  file { '/opt/data/media.txt':
    ensure => 'present',
  }

node default{}



 node stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
{
	
	include symlink
}

node stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
{
	
	include symlink
}

node stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
{
	
	include symlink
}


 puppet parser validate ecommerce.pp
 puppet apply ecommerce.pp --noop

 puppet agent --test
