The task needs to be performed using Puppet only. You can find more details below about the task.


Create a Puppet programming file news.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on master node i.e Jump Server, and using Puppet user resource add a user on all app servers as mentioned below:

Create a user siva and set its UID to 1752 on all Puppet agent nodes i.e all App Servers.

 # add user with uid
  user { 'siva':
    ensure     => 'present',
