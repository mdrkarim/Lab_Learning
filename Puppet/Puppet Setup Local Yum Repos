The Nautilus DevOps team was working on developing some custom RPMs to meet some application needs. Most of those RPMs will be installed on all application servers in Stratos Datacenter. So to accomplish this task we need to configure a local yum repository on all app servers so that we can install those custom RPMs from that local yum repository. But this task needs to be done using Puppet, below you can find more details.


Create a puppet programming file apps.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on master node i.e on Jump Server. Define a class local_yum_repo and perform below mentioned tasks:

There are some RPMs already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms on all puppet agent nodes i.e on all App Servers.

Create a local yum repository named yum_local (make sure to set Repository ID to yum_local). Configure it to use packages location /packages/downloaded_rpms on all puppet agent nodes i.e on all App Servers.

Install package vim-enhanced from this newly created repository through on all puppet agent nodes i.e on all App Servers.

Make sure to create a single puppet programming file apps.pp to configure local yum repository and install the package.

Note: Please perform this task using apps.pp only, do not create any separate inventory file.

touch /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/apps.pp
cd  /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/
vi apps.pp

class local_yum_repo {

  # Configure the repo we want to use
    yumrepo { 'yum_local':
  	name     =>'yum_local',
    enabled  => 1,
    descr    => 'Local repo holding company application packages',
    baseurl  => 'file:///packages/downloaded_rpms',
    gpgcheck => 0,
  }


include local_yum_repo

}

 class package_requires {

 package { 'vim-enhanced':
    ensure  => 'installed',
    require => Yumrepo['yum_local'], 
    #Confirmed you have Capital Yumrepo
  }

  include package_requires
}
node default{}

node 'stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com','stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com','stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com'

{
	
	include local_yum_repo
	include package_requires
}


puppet parser validate apps.pp
puppet apply apps.pp 
puppet agent --test

vim-enhanced --version
