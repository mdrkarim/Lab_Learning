The backup server in the Stratos DC contains several template XML files used by the Nautilus application. However, these template XML files must be populated with valid data before they can be used. One of the daily tasks of a system admin working in the xFusionCorp industries is to apply string and file manipulation commands!


Replace all occurances of the string Random to Marine on the XML file /root/nautilus.xml located in the backup server.



Find and replace text within a file using sed command
The procedure to change the text in files under Linux/Unix using sed:

Use Stream EDitor (sed) as follows:
sed -i 's/old-text/new-text/g' input.txt
The s is the substitute command of sed for find and replace
It tells sed to find all occurrences of ‘old-text’ and replace with ‘new-text’ in a file named input.txt
Verify that file has been updated:
more input.txt
Let us see syntax and usage in details.


cat /root/nautilus.xml
sed -i 's/Random/Marine/g' /root/nautilus.xml
