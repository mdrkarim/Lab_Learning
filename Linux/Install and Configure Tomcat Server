Install and Configure Tomcat Server
The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on one of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting, they have decided to use the tomcat application server. Based on the requirements mentioned below complete the task:


a. Install tomcat server on App Server 2 using yum.

b. Configure it to run on port 3003.

c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp. Deploy it on this tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e without specifying any sub-directory anything like this http://URL/ROOT .

d. You can access the website on LBR link. To do so click on the + button on top of your terminal, select option Select port to view on Host 1, and after adding port 80 click on Display Port.



yum install tomcat -y
cd tomcat
cd conf

vi server.xml
systemctl restart tomcat
systemctl start tomcat
systemctl enable tomcat
systemctl status tomcat

scp ROOT.war /var/lib/tomcat/webapps
cd /var/lib/tomcat
sudo systemctl restart tomcat
curl http://localhost:3003
