The document root /var/www/html of all web apps is on NFS share /data on storage server in Stratos Datacenter. We have a requirement where we want to password protect a directory in the Apache web server document root. We want to password protect http://<website-url>:<apache_port>/protected URL as per the following requirements (you can use any website-url for it like localhost since there are no such specific requirements as of now):


a. We want to use basic authentication.

b. We do not want to use htpasswd file base authentication. Instead, we want to use PAM authentication, i.e Basic Auth + PAM so that we can authenticate with a Linux user.

c. We already have a user ravi with password 8FmzjvFU6S which you need to provide access to.

d. You can access the website on LBR link. To do so click on the + button on top of your terminal, select Select port to view on Host 1, and after adding port 80 click on Display Port.

 
 vi  /etc/shadow #To see the sotred password
 vi  /etc/passwd #To see the user account and permission.

 yum --enablerepo=epel -y install mod_authnz_external pwauth

 vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/authnz_external.conf

 #Add the below settings

 <Directory /var/www/html/protected>
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "PAM Authentication"
    AuthBasicProvider external
    AuthExternal pwauth
    require valid-user
</Directory>

sudo systemctl restart httpd
sudo systemctl status httpd

curl -u ravi:8FmzjvFU6S http://localhost:8080/protected
