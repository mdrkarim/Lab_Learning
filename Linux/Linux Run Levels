A runlevel is one of the modes that a Unix-based operating system will run in. In Linux Kernel, there are 7 runlevels exists, starting from 0 to 6. The system can be booted into only one runlevel at a time. By default, a system boots either to runlevel 3 or to runlevel 5. Runlevel 3 is CLI, and 5 is GUI. The default runlevel is specified in /etc/inittab file in most Linux operating systems. Using runlevel, we can easily find out whether X is running, or network is operational, and so on. In this brief guide, we will talk about how to check the runlevel in Unix-like operating systems.
Check the Runlevel In Linux (Systemd)
In recent versions of Linux systems such as RHEL 7, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, the concept of runlevels has been replaced with systemd targets.
Here is the list of Systemd targets in Linux distributions,which were distributed with Systemd as default service manager.

runlevel0.target, poweroff.target – Halt
runlevel1.target, rescue.target – Single-user text mode
runlevel2.target, multi-user.target – Not used (user-definable)
runlevel3.target, multi-user.target – Full multi-user text mode
runlevel4.target, multi-user.target – Not used (user-definable)
runlevel5.target,graphical.target – Full multi-user graphical mode (with an X-based login screen)
runlevel6.target,reboot.target – Reboot
In Linux systems that are using Systemd as default service manager, you can find the current target using command:


systemctl get-default
systemctl set-default graphical.target
eg
multi-user.target/graphical.target
