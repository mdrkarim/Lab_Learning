The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems. One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers in Stratos DC.


Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. Also, do not try to change the Apache port on any host.
