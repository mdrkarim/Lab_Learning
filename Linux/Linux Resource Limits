On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:


a. soft limit = 73

b. hard_limit = 99



su nfsuser
ulimit -a
vi /etc/security/limits.conf

nfsuser          hard           nproc                91
nfsuser          soft           nproc                72
ulimit -H -u
ulimit -S -u

sysctl -p
