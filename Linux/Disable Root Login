After doing some security audits of servers, xFusionCorp Industries security team has implemented some new security policies. One of them is to disable direct root login through SSH.


Disable direct SSH root login on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter.

To disable root login, open the main ssh configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config with your choice of editor.

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#PermitRootLogin no
PermitRootLogin no

sudo systemctl restart sshd
